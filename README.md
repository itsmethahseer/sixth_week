# user_admin_crud
In this project i just created a user sign up and login pages. 
I connected my django with mysql database.
Then i created a admin login page and home pages for admin and users.
For crud operations i just created seperate pages . 
In this project i can update,delete,search and add users as a admin.
And used bootsrap for responsivity.
